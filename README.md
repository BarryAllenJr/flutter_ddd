# DDD in Dart/Flutter

This is an outcome of my attempt to understand Domain-Driven Design and consider how I can introduce it to app development in Flutter. The attempt began when I wondered what directory structure was better and started to try to figure it out. 

DDD may be too much for a small app like this, resulting in unnecessarily bloated code, but should benefits more in development of larger apps.
